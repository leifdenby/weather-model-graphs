    "The only input the graph generation in `weather-model-graphs` requires is the static `(x,y)` *grid* coordinates of the atmospheric state as the state changes over time. These coordinates are used to create the **grid nodes** nodes of the graph, with a node for each `(x,y)` coordinate.\n",
    "In addition to grid nodes the graph also contains **mesh nodes** that represent the latent space of the model at a set of `(x,y)` coordinates (this is in general a different set of coordinates to the **grid nodes** coordinates).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, there are two sets of nodes in the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **grid nodes**: representing the physical variables of the atmospheric state at a specific `(x,y)` coordinate\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mesh nodes**: representing the latent space of the model at specific `(x,y)` coordinate\n",
    "\n",
    "With these two sets of nodes, the graph is constructed by connecting the **grid nodes** to the **mesh nodes** and the **mesh nodes** to each other.\n",
    "The edges between the **grid nodes** and the **mesh nodes** represent the encoding of the physical variables into the latent space of the model, while the edges between the **mesh nodes** represent the processing of the latent space through the time evolution of the atmospheric state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the complete message-passing graph consists of three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **grid-to-mesh** (`g2m`): the encoding compenent, where edges represent the encoding of physical variables into the latent space of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mesh-to-mesh** (`m2m`): the processing component, where edges represent information flow between nodes updating the latent presentation at mesh nodes through the time evolution of the atmospheric state\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mesh-to-grid** (`m2g`): the decoding component, where edges represent the decoding of the latent space back into physical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, the **mesh-to-grid** and **grid-to-mesh** updates can probably also encode some of the time evolution processing, in addition to the latent space encoding/decoding, unless the GNN is trained specifically as an auto-encoder using the same graph as input and output.\n"

    "## Design principles\n",
    "\n",
    "The key design principle of `weather-model-graphs` is to work with `networkx.DiGraph` objects as the primary data structure for the graph representation right until the graph is to be stored on disk into a specific format.\n",
    "Using only `networkx.DiGraph` objects as the intermediate representations makes it possible to\n",
    "\n",
    "1) easily modularise the whole generation process, with every step outputting a `networkx.DiGraph` object,\n",
    "2) easily visualise the graph resulting from any step and\n",
    "3) easily connect graph nodes across graph components, combine graphs and split graphs based on node and edge attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph generation in `weather-model-graphs` is split into to the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the three graph components of the message-passing graph that constitute the auto-regressive atmospheric flow model, all represented by `networkx.DiGraph` objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **grid-to-mesh** (`g2m`): the encoding compenent, where edges represent the encoding of physical variables into the latent space of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **mesh-to-mesh** (`m2m`): the processing component, where edges represent information flow between nodes through the time evolution of the atmospheric state\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **mesh-to-grid** (`m2g`): the decoding component, where edges represent the decoding of the latent space back into physical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Combine all three graph components into a single `networkx.DiGraph` object and create a unique node identifier for each node in the combined graph.\n",
    "3. Split the combined graph into the three *output* graph components again (or more if the specific graph architecture requires it).\n",
    "4. Store each of the *output* graph components in the desired format, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **networkx** `.pickle` file: save `networkx.DiGraph` objects using `pickle` to disk (`weather_model_graphs.save.to_pickle(...)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [pytorch-geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) for [neural-lam](https://github.com/mllam/neural-lam): edges indexes and features are stored in separate `torch.Tensor` objects serialised to disk that can then be loaded into `torch_geometric.data.Data` objects (`weather_model_graphs.save.to_pyg(...)`)"
